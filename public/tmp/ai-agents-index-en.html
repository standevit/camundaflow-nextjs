  <h3>What does an AI agent do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Understands</strong> natural language customer requests (email, chat, ticket, voice)</li>
    <li><strong>Decides</strong> which process to start (intent detection)</li>
    <li><strong>Acts</strong>: invokes services, writes to CRM/ERP, creates tickets, schedules appointments</li>
    <li><strong>Asks for clarification</strong> when uncertain (instead of acting incorrectly)</li>
    <li><strong>Learns</strong> from feedback and historical cases (if desired)</li>
    <li><strong>Remains controllable</strong> — every step is traceable in Camunda</li>
  </ul>
